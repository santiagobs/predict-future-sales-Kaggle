My main features include:

Extracting type and subtype codes from items/shop names.
Agregations for target variable for shops and items alone
Lag features for target variable, revenue, sales for shops and items, among others
Mean encoding for item category and item id
Train/test split is set up considering time, also I use a simple mix ensemble model with LGB and Linear Regression.
